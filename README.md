This repository is created to house the jupyter notebook and csv data file as part of the assessment for SGH's job application.
Copy and paste the file location of the csv data file into the first argument of the pd.read_csv function (which is found in the second cell)
Run all the cells of jupyter notebook to see my visualisations.
I have included a brief analysis for each visualisation
