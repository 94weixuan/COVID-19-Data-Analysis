This repository is created to house the jupyter notebook and csv data file as part of the assessment for SGH's job application.
The aim of the assessment is to create 3 informative visualizations about Covid-19 using Python in a Jupyter notebook, starting with the data set at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sambelkacem/covid19-algeria-and-world-dataset/code.
This solution includes the following:
o Converting data to a tidy format
o Exporting to normalized tables in an SQLite3 database
o Using SQL statements (using from within pandas is acceptable) to retrieve the data needed for each visualization 

Notes:
1) Copy and paste the file location of the csv data file into the first argument of the pd.read_csv function (which is found in the second cell)
2) Run all the cells of jupyter notebook to see my visualisations.
3) I have included a brief analysis for each visualisation
